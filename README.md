# Solargraph ARC

[Solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) **A**wesome **R**ails **C**completions

## Features

- fixes autocompletion for multi-level classes defined in 1 line `class Foo::Bar::Baz`. See https://github.com/castwide/solargraph/issues/506
- autocomplete database columns by parsing db/schema.rb
- autocomplete of model relations
- parsing of `delegate` calls
- completions for methods generated by Devise (`current_user`, `sign_in_and_redirect`, etc)
- better support for running solargraph outside bundle
- better completion inside controllers. `request`, `response`, `params`, etc.
- autocomplete inside routes.rb
- autocomplete inside migrations
- completions for methods generated by ActiveStorage
- better ActiveRecord completions

Still. Due to dynamic nature of some Rails code, not all completion candidates are returned. For an up to date coverage report, please see https://github.com/alisnic/solargraph-arc/tree/master/coverage.
